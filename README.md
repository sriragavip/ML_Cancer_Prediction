# ML_Cancer_Prediction


*Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression*

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has cancer. The model is built using logistic regression, a supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used for binary classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of cancer patient. The model is then evaluated on a test set of patients to assess its accuracy.

The code in this repository is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
       * NumPy
       * Pandas
       * Scikit-learn
